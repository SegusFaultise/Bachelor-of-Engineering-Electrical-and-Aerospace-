### Description

This class provides students with an introduction to principal concepts and methods of fluid mechanics. Topics covered in the course include pressure, hydrostatics, and buoyancy; open systems and control volume analysis; mass conservation and momentum conservation for moving fluids; viscous fluid flows, flow through pipes; dimensional analysis; boundary layers, and lift and drag on objects. Students will work to formulate the models necessary to study, analyze, and design fluid systems through the application of these concepts, and to develop the problem-solving skills essential to good engineering practice of fluid mechanics in practical applications.

Students will have the opportunity to demonstrate a familiarity and ability to work on fluid mechanics. These outcomes will be demonstrated through an assessment of homework assignments and two quizzes.

This class is part of the [Course 2-A curriculum](http://meche.mit.edu/academic/undergraduate/course2a/) for students whose academic and career goals demand greater breadth and flexibility than are allowed un
